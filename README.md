# dcl-knowledge-tracking
Nb: to be completed

## The Issue :
A "knowledge/experience record tracking tool". 

One of the issues NGOs are facing is to : 
- track, recognize and value local expertise.

It's hard for them to identify people who have experience in a very specific domain or with a particular expertise. 
And generally, these people (mainly from the 'Global South') are interviewed by someone (generally from the 'North') without any mention or recognition in the final article/report. This is wrong because it's a very extractive way of producing knowledge and content. With blockchain, we could record the contributions of grassroots activists/local people/indigenous/any bearers of knowledge. This would allow the person to build an onchain portfolio that anyone could see, and potentially be retro-funded or receive funds retroactively. 

As for now, it's a plug-in that will help track contribution on-chain when someone publish an article/report/videos online. 
The idea is to enable the user to log in with their wallet, recognize any contribution and generate an attestation for all the contributors and include a "split" function. Allowing retro-giving/funding for the document + being quoted as co-publisher if (enough) funds are sent to the smart contract.
Need to provide also widget/API for website to display in the article these informations. 

This can go further because : 
You can visualize the data through knowledge graph 
And then see which wallets create reports, articles etc..., who's generating knowledge around which topic ? Who's often quoted etc... We can easily identify nodes with high centrality and better retro-give these knowledge contributors. 
By using tags, some protocols/actors would be able to reward dedicated subgroups.
